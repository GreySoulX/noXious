This is a very simple Chrome extention that I wrote a couple months ago to block twitter/X content and links without otherwise changing the look/feel of the page. I uses simple placeholders for embeds and strips the link from text so you don't see it. Out of sight, out of mind.

I tried to publish this as a legitimate extention, but haven't found a way to access all open tabs to block links and embeds from loading without using broad permissions which I guess Google doesn't like. Feel free to reach out and help me improve on this if you like!
